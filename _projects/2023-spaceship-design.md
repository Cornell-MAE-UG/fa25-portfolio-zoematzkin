For this project, I took apart a weed wacker with my groups to analyze and then teach about the fluid mechanics of the system. I focused on the fuel line that carries gasoline from the fuel tank to the carburetor. I analyzed the engine as a whole to determine the flow rate of the fuel, and then used this flow rate and the dimensions of the pipe to determine the speed of the gasoline in the line. With this speed, I was able to find the reynolds number of the moving gas and the viscoss losses of pressure. Aside from looking at the fuel line, I also helped edit the video together.<br>
