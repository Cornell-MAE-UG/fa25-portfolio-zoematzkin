## About Me

![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/profile_pic_2.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi! I’m Zoe Matzkin, a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for aircraft design and structural analysis. I’m part of CUAir, Cornell’s autonomous aircraft project team, where I work on the Structures and Payloads subteam designing and testing components for our plane. I love tackling challenging engineering problems, especially those that combine creativity with hands-on design.

At Cornell, I am currently taking Introduction to Aeronautics, where I am working with a team to create a glider. The glider is optimized to go as slowly as possible for 25 meters. This is made possible by being incredibly light and with a low camber airfoil (that allows for easy manaufactuirng).

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
